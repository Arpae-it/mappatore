    longDescription: |
      Mappatore is a simple and fast Shiny interface written in R used mainly to
      show public WMS services. The simple code is very easily editable to add
      more WMS services. It also allows the user to upload a kml file and plot
      it along with the already shown WMS layers. The main use is to provide a
      very fast and simple small online GIS that can also be used in the field
      by all the operators who need a map on the fly with different reference
      layers. It also provides a very simple way to translate coordinates from
      geographical (WGS84) to UTM32. When used in the field from a smartphone or
      tablet it automatically brings the user to his/her position and it can be
      used to reverse georeference any point on the fly. An implementation of it
      is available freely at: https://arpae.shinyapps.io/mappatore/
